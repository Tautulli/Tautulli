# PlexPy
#
# Service Unit file for systemd system manager
#
# INSTALLATION NOTES
#
#	1. Rename this file as you want, ensuring that it ends in .service
#		e.g. 'plexpy.service'
#
#	2. Adjust configuration settings as required.  More details in the
#	   "CONFIGURATION NOTES" section shown below.
#
#	3. Copy this file into your systemd service unit directory, which is
#	   often '/lib/systemd/system'.
#
#	4. Create any files/directories that you specified back in step #2.
#		e.g. '/etc/plexpy/plexpy.ini'
#			 '/home/sabnzbd/.plexpy'
#
#	5. Enable boot-time autostart with the following commands:
#		systemctl daemon-reload
#		systemctl enable plexpy.service
#
#	6. Start now with the following command:
#		systemctl start plexpy.service
#
#   7. If troubleshooting startup-errors, start by checking permissions
#      and ownership on the files/directories that you created in step #4.
#
#
# CONFIGURATION NOTES
#
#	 - The example settings in this file assume that:
#		1. You will run PlexPy as user/group: sabnzbd.sabnzbd
#		2. You will either have PlexPy installed as a subdirectory
#		   under '~sabnzbd', or that you will have a symlink under
#		   '~/sabnzbd' pointing to your PlexPy install dir.
#	    3. Your PlexPy data directory and configuration file will be
#		   in separate locations from your PlexPy install dir, to
#		   simplify updates.
#			
#    - Option names (e.g. ExecStart=, Type=) appear to be case-sensitive)
#
#    - Adjust ExecStart= to point to:
# 		1. Your PlexPy executable,
# 		2. Your config file (recommended is to put it somewhere in /etc)
#       3. Your datadir (recommended is to NOT put it in your PlexPy exec dir)
#
#    - Adjust User= and Group= to the user/group you want PlexPy to run as.
#
#    - WantedBy= specifies which target (i.e. runlevel) to start PlexPy for.
#        multi-user.target equates to runlevel 3 (multi-user text mode)
#        graphical.target  equates to runlevel 5 (multi-user X11 graphical mode)
