"""CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented HTTP framework.


CherryPy consists of not one, but four separate API layers.

The APPLICATION LAYER is the simplest. CherryPy applications are written as
a tree of classes and methods, where each branch in the tree corresponds to
a branch in the URL path. Each method is a 'page handler', which receives
GET and POST params as keyword arguments, and returns or yields the (HTML)
body of the response. The special method name 'index' is used for paths
that end in a slash, and the special method name 'default' is used to
handle multiple paths via a single handler. This layer also includes:

 * the 'exposed' attribute (and cherrypy.expose)
 * cherrypy.quickstart()
 * _cp_config attributes
 * cherrypy.tools (including cherrypy.session)
 * cherrypy.url()

The ENVIRONMENT LAYER is used by developers at all levels. It provides
information about the current request and response, plus the application
and server environment, via a (default) set of top-level objects:

 * cherrypy.request
 * cherrypy.response
 * cherrypy.engine
 * cherrypy.server
 * cherrypy.tree
 * cherrypy.config
 * cherrypy.thread_data
 * cherrypy.log
 * cherrypy.HTTPError, NotFound, and HTTPRedirect
 * cherrypy.lib

The EXTENSION LAYER allows advanced users to construct and share their own
plugins. It consists of:

 * Hook API
 * Tool API
 * Toolbox API
 * Dispatch API
 * Config Namespace API

Finally, there is the CORE LAYER, which uses the core API's to construct
the default components which are available at higher layers. You can think
of the default components as the 'reference implementation' for CherryPy.
Megaframeworks (and advanced users) may replace the default components
with customized or extended components. The core API's are:

 * Application API
 * Engine API
 * Request API
 * Server API
 * WSGI API

These API's are described in the `CherryPy specification <https://bitbucket.org/cherrypy/cherrypy/wiki/CherryPySpec>`_.

def popargs(*args, **kwargs):
    """A decorator for _cp_dispatch
    (cherrypy.dispatch.Dispatcher.dispatch_method_name).

    Optional keyword argument: handler=(Object or Function)

    Provides a _cp_dispatch function that pops off path segments into
    cherrypy.request.params under the names specified.  The dispatch
    is then forwarded on to the next vpath element.

    Note that any existing (and exposed) member function of the class that
    popargs is applied to will override that value of the argument.  For
    instance, if you have a method named "list" on the class decorated with
    popargs, then accessing "/list" will call that function instead of popping
    it off as the requested parameter.  This restriction applies to all
    _cp_dispatch functions.  The only way around this restriction is to create
    a "blank class" whose only function is to provide _cp_dispatch.

    If there are path elements after the arguments, or more arguments
    are requested than are available in the vpath, then the 'handler'
    keyword argument specifies the next object to handle the parameterized
    request.  If handler is not specified or is None, then self is used.
    If handler is a function rather than an instance, then that function
    will be called with the args specified and the return value from that
    function used as the next object INSTEAD of adding the parameters to
    cherrypy.request.args.

    This decorator may be used in one of two ways:

    As a class decorator:
    @cherrypy.popargs('year', 'month', 'day')
    class Blog:
        def index(self, year=None, month=None, day=None):
            #Process the parameters here; any url like
            #/, /2009, /2009/12, or /2009/12/31
            #will fill in the appropriate parameters.

        def create(self):
            #This link will still be available at /create.  Defined functions
            #take precedence over arguments.

    Or as a member of a class:
    class Blog:
        _cp_dispatch = cherrypy.popargs('year', 'month', 'day')
        #...

    The handler argument may be used to mix arguments with built in functions.
    For instance, the following setup allows different activities at the
    day, month, and year level:

    class DayHandler:
        def index(self, year, month, day):
            #Do something with this day; probably list entries

        def delete(self, year, month, day):
