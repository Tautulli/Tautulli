"""An implementation of the Web Site Process Bus.

This module is completely standalone, depending only on the stdlib.

Web Site Process Bus
--------------------

A Bus object is used to contain and manage site-wide behavior:
daemonization, HTTP server start/stop, process reload, signal handling,
drop privileges, PID file management, logging for all of these,
and many more.

In addition, a Bus object provides a place for each web framework
to register code that runs in response to site-wide events (like
process start and stop), or which controls or otherwise interacts with
the site-wide components mentioned above. For example, a framework which
uses file-based templates would add known template filenames to an
autoreload component.

Ideally, a Bus object will be flexible enough to be useful in a variety
of invocation scenarios:

 1. The deployer starts a site from the command line via a
    framework-neutral deployment script; applications from multiple frameworks
    are mixed in a single site. Command-line arguments and configuration
    files are used to define site-wide components such as the HTTP server,
    WSGI component graph, autoreload behavior, signal handling, etc.
 2. The deployer starts a site via some other process, such as Apache;
    applications from multiple frameworks are mixed in a single site.
    Autoreload and signal handling (from Python at least) are disabled.
 3. The deployer starts a site via a framework-specific mechanism;
    for example, when running tests, exploring tutorials, or deploying
    single applications from a single framework. The framework controls
    which site-wide components are enabled as it sees fit.

The Bus object in this package uses topic-based publish-subscribe
messaging to accomplish all this. A few topic channels are built in
('start', 'stop', 'exit', 'graceful', 'log', and 'main'). Frameworks and
site containers are free to define their own. If a message is sent to a
channel that has not been defined or has no listeners, there is no effect.

In general, there should only ever be a single Bus object per process.
Frameworks and site containers share a single Bus object by publishing
messages and subscribing listeners.

The Bus object works as a finite state machine which models the current
state of the process. Bus methods move it from one state to another;
those methods then publish to subscribed listeners on the channel for
the new state.::

                        V
       STOPPING --> STOPPED --> EXITING -> X
          A   A         |
          |    \___     |
          |        \    |
          |         V   V
