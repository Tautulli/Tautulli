    Securely hash and check passwords using PBKDF2.

    Use random salts to protect againt rainbow tables, many iterations against
    brute-force, and constant-time comparaison againt timing attacks.

    Keep parameters to the algorithm together with the hash so that we can
    change the parameters and keep older hashes working.
